# 📊 Coursera Courses Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Unsupervised Machine Learning using a dataset obtained through web scraping from the Coursera website. The goal is to uncover insights about course subjects, institutions, trending skills, and popular course topics. Additionally, the project involves clustering the courses using K-Means, K-Modes, and DBSCAN algorithms to identify patterns and groupings within the data.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **File Name:** `Coursera.csv`
- **Contains:** Course titles, subjects, institutions, ratings, reviews, gained skills, and levels.
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Coursera Courses and Skills Dataset 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yosefxx590/coursera-courses-and-skills-dataset-2025)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data analysis, visualization, and web scraping

## 📌 Machine Learning Methodology
### Model Selection
Three unsupervised machine learning models were trained for clustering the dataset:

1-K-Means

2-K-Modes

3-DBSCAN

These models were chosen to handle both numerical and categorical data effectively and to explore different clustering approaches.

### Feature Engineering
Steps taken to enhance model performance:
- **Encoding categorical data**
- **Feature scaling and normalization**
- **Extracting new features from existing ones**

### Hyperparameter Optimization
Tuning was performed to improve model accuracy and efficiency.

### Performance Evaluation
- Various metrics and visualizations were used to compare models.
- The best-performing model was selected based on key performance indicators.
